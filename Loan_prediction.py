Data and Description

Loan_ID: Unique Loan ID
Gender: Male/ Female
Married: Applicant married (Y/N)
Dependents: Number of dependents
Education: Applicant Education (Graduate/ Under Graduate)
Self_Employed: Self employed (Y/N)
ApplicantIncome: Applicant income
CoapplicantIncome: Coapplicant income
LoanAmount: Loan amount in thousands
Loan_Amount_Term: Term of loan in months
Credit_History: credit history meets guidelines
Property_Area: Urban/ Semi Urban/ Rural
Loan_Status: Loan approved (Y/N)
"""


"""
Before starting to code, I am trying to come up with a few Null Hypothesis:
    1. Applicant Income - Higher the income of the applicant, higher will be the chance of loan approval
    2. Loan Amount - Higher the loan amount, lesser will be the chance of getting the loan approved
    3. Loan_Amount_Term - Higher the loan amount term, lesser will be the chance of getting the loan approved
    4. Credit_History: People who have repaid their previous loans, have a higher chance of getting their loan approved
    5. Property_Area: If property in urban area, the chance of getting the loan getting approved should be higher
